## Welcome to Lesson 00!

Please click the big green "Code" button and click "Open in GitHub Desktop" (which you now have installed, correct?). If you are on Windows or macOS, then you should see "Open in GitHub Desktop". If you are doing this course on Linux, you will have to copy the HTTPS link and use it to clone the repo manually in GitHub Desktop.

Create a directory called "Lessons" in your "pycode" directory and clone this repository into that "Lessons" directory.

This first lesson is intended to introduce you to JupyterLab, Python, and the FEA library, PyNiteFEA. Start with "Lesson_00_A" and proceed to "Lesson_00_C", in sequence.

I want you to build a level of comfort using Python and PyNiteFEA as an "application" meaning you are simply executing commands in JupyterLab notebook cells to create a beam model and analyze it.

Do not worry! You do not need to "know Python" to do this. It is kind of like entering commands to perform a beam analysis.
